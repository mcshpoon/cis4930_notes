> Q: Why doesn't the `Director` get the `Product` from the `Builder`?

A: The `Director` has no clue to the `Product`'s type! The `Director`
knows only the *process* used for creation, *not* what is actually being
created. 

![UML diagram of pizzaBuildre, bla]()

The `Director` is reusable -- we can use the same *process* to create
different representations. 

A `CBuilder` is reusable -- it encapsulates knowledge about how to
assemble a particular `Product` *representation*.

This scheme provides a strong *encapsulation boundary*: the
representation is decoupled from the construction process. 

The `Builder` pattern provides fine-grained control over *how* an
object(-structure) [He is putting structure in parens because maybe
we're just instantiating an object, and configuring an object.] is
assembled/configured. All the other GoF *Creational Patterns* allow one
to request only a particular `Product` type -- they don't allow one to get
involved with the assembly-configuration process. 

Note: That's not to say that the implementer of one of those other
patterns cannot specify how an oject, or object structure is created,
because they most certainly can. 

ex: 

``` java
Foo makeFoo() {
  Foo f = new DaveCoFoo();
  f.addBell( new LargeClangyBell() );
  f.addWhistle( new ShrillAnnoyingWhistle() );
  return f;
  // returns a foo that is configured with Bells & Whistles. 
}
```

-- but how this differs is that when `makeFoo()` is called, one *always*
gets a `DaveCoFoo()` configured with a `LargeClangyBell` and
`ShrillAnnoyingWhistle`. Clients of this method  weren't given the opportunity to:

* customise the accessories, nor
* change the representation

> 1. implementation of techniques 3 & 5 require *something* to configure
   the AF. Should that knowledge be localised? 

A: 

> *yupperdoodles!*

If so, where?

either:

  * in a *subclass* of the AF, *or*
    * *the* (subclassed) AF's constructor would know what `Product`
      types to use
  * in a FM [better choice]

Aside:

``` java
class MealFactory<BudgetMeal, RegularMeal, PlurgeMeal>
{
  BudgetMeal b;
  RegularMeal r;
  PlurgeMeal p;

  MealFactory(){
    b = new BudgetMeal();
    r = new RegularMeal();
    p = new PlurgeMeal();
  }

  BudgetMeal makeBudgetMeal() {
    return b.clone();
  }

  // ...
}
```

Should localise it to make it reusable, and gives a clue where to look
when you want to make changes. 

Example of how to localise it: 

``` java
// example of parameterising the constructor 
FruitFactory makeFruitFactory() {
  return new FruitFactory( new Apple(), new Peach(), ... );
}

// parameterising the class
FruitFactory makeFruitFactory() {
  return new FruitFactory<Apple, Peach, ..>();
}
```

> 2. Why is it easier to extend a SF-based AF than a FM-based one to
> support additional product types? 

Adding a new method to support the `Product` type will require that the
base class/interface be modified, necessiating the updating of *all* of
its subclasses, so that they support the new operation(s).

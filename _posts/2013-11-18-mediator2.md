# Mediator(273)

## Initial comments

### Example: good use of a `Mediator` [cont]

#### How to avoid encumbering widgets? 

Define the interactions between the GUI widgets using a `Mediator`. 

![Image of View-App-Domain model]()

> and mediating between components.

* the `Colleagues` (the GUI widgets -- need to interact, but don't know
  each other) communicate with the `Mediator` when their state changes.

> Davis: like in movies, where people say things like "Tell Anne to pass
> me the salt"

* the `Mediator`, on receiving notice, takes appropriate action by
  sending one or more of the `Colleagues` (one or more) message(s)
  - the `Mediator` is defining the interaction between the colleagues

## Collaborating Patterns

The `Mediator` is frequently used with `Observer`, which implements the
event notification mecahnism.

### MVC evolved (Model-View-Controller)

As the MVC evolved, it was realised that it would make more sense to
factor models into two parts: Domain Model, and Application Model. 

#### Domain Model (DM)

The "business" objects: they have *no* concept of user interfaces or how
they will be displayed. They'll work just fine, even if there is no user
interface. 

#### Application Model (AM)

* Provides user-interface support. The `View` is still responsible for
doing the displaying. The `Application Model` provides suport to the `View` needs. Typically, `AM` objects contain little state -- instead, an `AM` object derives its state from (one or more) `DM` objects. 
  * acts as an `Adapter` by converting the domain interface to the
    interface the `View` expects. 
  * provides resources that are not part of the `domain` (e.g., the
    __concept__ of menus, not NOT the displaying. It is aware of menus,
what their purpose is, but is not in of itself a menu). 
  * serves as a `Mediator` to coordinate the `View` widgets. 

### Value-holder Model

> Davis: Separates the concept of the value from the object that *holds*
> the value

![Diagram of name fields]()

* Consider a system where a user types a name. 
  - the AM asks the DM if there's an `age` associated with that `name`. 
  - if so, the AM tells the `NumericValueHolder` to update its value
    * which in turn, causes the `NumericTextArea` to display the age. 

![Diagram flowchart of `SpecifcAppModel`]()

> Davis: The blue lines are things observing other things. 

> Davis: The TextArea only knows about `ValueHolder`s. This makes the
> StringValueHolder GUI-independent. 

> Davis: Separate the idea of "here is a variable that can hold a
> string" from a GUI representation. It should be re-usable, and should
> *not* be coupled to a `SpecifciDomainModel`. SpecificDomainmodel knows
> _nothing_ about GUI. The SpecificAppModel knows how interactions
> between GUI models work. 

## Closing Comments

### Colleagues

* `Colleagues` are highly reusable. 
  * they are *not* encumbered with application-specific crap. 

### Mediators

* `Mediator`s tend *not* to be reusable
  * because they implement context-specific behaviours (i.e., crap)

### Conclusion

Generally, if an object is encapsulating a complex behaviour limited
to a *well-defined* subsystem, it's __probably__ a `Mediator`. But if it
has too many responsibilities, or it crosses conceptual boundaries, then
it's __probably__ an an *Evil God Object*, and one should immediately
launch a jihad/crusade/holy-war against it. 

# Facade (185)

## Intent

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a
subsystem. `Facade` defines a higher level interface that makes the
subsystem easier to use. 

## Initial Comments

* often used to promote *layering*
* does *not* preclude from one using elements of the subsystem
  directly should one so desire 

## Structure

![UML of Facade]()

> Davis: The facade straddles a "box" or subsystem. 

## Additional Comments

* One uses the subsystem services through either: 
  * the `Facade`
  * via subsystem elements

It is an *abomination* to mix the two. 

> Davis: Either you use the `Facade`, or ya __don't__

The `Facade`'s `easyToUseOp()` may instantiate multiple subsystem
objects, compose them, and invoke a variety of operations on them,
before returning a result. 

The operations that the `Facade` defines should be (relatively)
complete; It _may_ be the case (though unusual) to effect the desired
results. 

## Analogy: g++

* There are multiple phases of compilation: 
  - preprocessor
    * `g++ -E in.cpp > preprocessed_in.cpp`
  - compile
    * `g++ -c in.preprocessed_in.cpp` // creates file preprocessed.o
  - link
    * `g++ -o executable preprocessed.io`

As a convenience, there are ways to do all the steps with one command: 

* all-in-one
  - `g++ -o executable in.cpp`

## Facades in Java

Java has `package`s

* classes declared `public` may be used outside the `package`s
  - those that aren't, can't

Thus, when we define a `Facade` for a `package`, it _must_ be declared
`public`. 

Subsystems *may* have other `public` classes that aren't involved

* A package may be used to: 
  - encapsulate a set of classes meant to work together
  - encapsulate a set of _uncoupled_ classes with similar functionality
    * e.g., Java's `Collections` package, defines a bunch of independent
      container classes

`Facade` is going to be used with the first one, classes meant to work
together.

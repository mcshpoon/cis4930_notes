# Administrivia

* Exam 1: tomorrow night! <3

# Decorator (175)

## Participants (alternative to what apperas in the GoF)

Idea: Transparency. Clients should not know whether or not they're using a decorated, or not interface. 
overrides *specific* `Component`operation(s)

* extend an operation so that it does work before and/or after forwarding the request to the component.
* replace an operation, so that the `CDecorator`is soley responsible for fulfilling the request.
* define new behaviour(s)
	* ugghh!
	* in order to use a behaviour that doesn't exist in the `Component`interface, the `Client`is *required* to know that it is working with a particular `CDecorator`that supports the operation. Hence, the loss of transparency.

## Observations

### Decorators can be chained - Decorators can decorate decorated things

Client -> CDecorator => CDecoratorB => CComponent

Examples of this in Java include:

* Using `JScrollPane`to decorate another `JComponent`
* Border; Borders can decorate border'd components.
* IOStreams

## Where the pattern has applied

Most use of the `Decorator`pattern has been in "system software", as opposed to being used to model domains. 

> Davis: In a moment, though, we'll see an example of `Decorator`being used in the modelling domain. 

## Boilerplate redux

Sometimes we just want to say, "This is how X differs from Y.

As with the boilerplate example we covered in our `Prototype` dicussion our insurance company will have three standard policies (Basic, Deluxe, & Premium). Clients can request customised versions, varying the coverage, adding/removing events, modifying covered amounts, ,&c. 

### Process for cusotmising a policy

#### Step 1. Instantiate a concrete SLIP (Sud-Net Life Ins-Rants Policy)

* instantiate a concrete SLIP -- e.g., a `BasicSLIP`
* set the attribute values (`policyNumber`, &c. and info about the `ÃŒnsuredParty`)
* as part of the construction process, the `Map` will be populated with default values

#### Step 2. Customise the SLIP 

* customise the SLIP for the desired coverage by wrapping it with a `SLIPDecorator on which the desired policy endorsements have been set. 

On the `Decorator`

``` java
setCoverage( tattooEvent, new Policy( 100%, $100,000 );
setCoverage( infectedPiercingEvent, new Policy( 0%, $0 ); // note that this is how we remove a particular coverage
```

Note: the first shows how to add/change an endorsement from the basic SLIP. The second shows how to remove one.

#### Step 3. Give the decorated SLIP to the client

The client will know only the _decorated_ SLIP, which implements `getCoverage()` as:

``` java
Policy getCoverage( Event e ){
	Policy p = map.get( e );

	// if this was not an endorsement handled by this Decorator, then pass it up the chain
	if ( p = null )
		p = slip.getCoverage( e );
	return p;
}
```

So, the getCoverage will pass up the chain to the object it wraps. 

#### Comments

A SLIPDecorator stores the _differences_ between the original and modified component. That component may be another Decorator, or it may be a SLIP. 

* pro: no copying needed -- reduces storage cost (the `CSLIP`might even be sharable!)
* pro: easier to identify what it's changed relative to the boilerplate object
	* cos all the differences, and __only__ the differences are encapsulated in the Decorator(s)
* pro: Decorators can be chained
* con: greater implementation overhead

Overall: good for complex cases with deeply nested objects

## Decorator compared with other patterns

### Strategy

Both can be chained.

Consider a `Component`/`Context` which is capable of rendering itself. 

![Image that has a border, that has a border]()

The decroator version:

![Image of a Decorator -> Decorator -> Component]()

The top Decorator is: Thick red border, second is Thick Black Border (R), and last is Gradient.

Strategy Version: 

![Image of Context -> Strategy -> Strategy; Last Strategy loops around to Context]()

in both cases, the same image will be output. 

#### Decorator version

* extended `op()` calls `op`
	* e.g., in the example above: 
	* ```render( Graphics2D ) => render( Graphics2D ) => render( Graphics2D )```
* changes the `Component`'s "skin".
* the `Decorator`'s interface must *conform* to the `Component`'s interface.

#### Strategy version

* implements a *chainable* `op()`

for example: 

````java
op( context ){
	if( nextStrategy != null )
		nextStrategy.op( context );
	doMySpecialStrategyStuffs();
}
```

* the `Context` will invoke its `Strategy`'s `op()`
* change the (`Context`'s) "guts"
* the `Strategy` interface will be dictated by the needs of the algorithm family. which it encapsulates.
	* it will almost certainly *not8 conform to the `Context`'s interface. 

> Davis: Instead of changing its skin, think of it as changing the Context's "guts".

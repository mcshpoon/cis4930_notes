# Memento (283)

## Intent

Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalise an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.

## Initial Comment

An object may have a *lot* of state -- How much of that state actually needs to be captured is going to depend on the application's needs.  

## Structure 

![Diagram from Silverfox or Phone, WHATEVER MOM!]()

* Originator: The thing whose state is being externalised
* Caretaker: 
* Memento: Encapsulates the state

## Mechanism 

In Java, it's particularly *easy* to implement `Memento`. 

* Define an empty interface `Memento`
* Whenever an `Originator` is asked to create a `Memento`, it will construct and return an instance of an object that inplements that interface (in an `Originator`-specific way). 
* the class implementing `Memento` can be a private member of the `Originator` class. 

## Implementation Issues

As with `Prototype`, one must decide whether a deep copy is necessary, or a shadow copy will suffice. 

If one is creating a *lot* of `Memento`s (or even just a few of a particularly heavy `Originator`), it may take a great deal of memory to hold them.

The memory requirements can be mitigated by having the `Memento` store __just__ incremental changes -- i.e., the stuff that has been modified since the last `Memento` was created. 

* e.g., with a bitmap (image), preserve the affected region (rather than the entire image). 
	* then we can restore the image to its original state by just repainting the affected region with the preserved data. 

A `Memento` may save the `Originator`'s: 

* entire state
* a sub-set of its state
* just the recently changed aspects 

## Example in Java

``` java
class Originator {
	private int a;
	String[] s;
	
	private class OriginatorMemento implements Memento{ // Memento interface has NO methods
		int aCopy; // notice! He didn't declare *private*
		String[] sCopy;

		OriginatorMemento() {
			aCopy = a;
			sCopy = s; // might want to make a duplicate of the array here 
		}

		void restore( Originator anOriginator ){
			if( anOriginator != Originator.this ){
				throw new SomeTerribleException( "naughty! naughty!" );
				// this is naughty, cos it's trying to restore another ClassOriginator's brain into this one. 
			}
			a = aCopy;
			s = sCopy;
		}
	} // end class OriginatorMemento 
		
	public Memento makeMemento() {
		return new OriginatorMemento();
	}

	public void restore( Memento m ){
		( (OriginatorMemento) m ).restore( this );
	}

	// other Originator methods elided
}
```

Java note: had we not passed a reference to `this` to the call to `restore()`, a `Memento` created by another `Originator` could be used to do a __brain transplant__. 

> Davis: Note, it's __Halloween__ time, __VERY__ scary. Please be cautious.

Brain transplants are cool, but that's not what the pattern is about.

# Cursor 

This is an *alternative* to the `Iterator` pattern. 

Note: The `Cursor` is not really capturing any of the creating object's state of the object's state, but rather the `state` of a *traversal* over that object's elements. 

## Example in Java

``` java
interface Cursor { // define a type, so we can maintain a reference 
// we don't want to say anything about that `Type`
}

class Gizmo {
	private Widget[] widget;

	private class GizmoCursor implements Cursor {
		int i = 0; 
	}
	
	public Cursor makeCusor() {
		return new GizmoCursor();
	}
}
```

Note: if you wrote `GizmoCursor` as an anonymous class inside `makeCusor()`, you wouldn't be able to cast it back later. The `Originator` needs to know what it is, so that it can cast it back during the `restore()` process. 

## Canonical Usage 

``` java
Gizmo g = ...;
// ...
Cursor c = g.makeCursor();

for( g.first( c ); g.hasNext( c ); g.next( c ) ){
	// do something with g.currentElement( c )	
}
```

> Davis: What does this look like? Canonical Usage of `Iterator`!

``` java
public void first( Cursor c ) {
	( (GizmoCursor) c ).i = 0;
}

public boolean hasNext( Cursor c ) {
	return ( (GizmoCursor) c ).i < widget.length;
}

public widget currentElement( Cursor c ) {
	return widget[ ( (GizmoCursor) c ).i ];
}

public void next( Cursor c ) {
	++( (GizmoCursor) c).i;
}

// other Gizmo operations elided
```

### Observations

The `Gizmo` class defines an interface that permits multiple simultaneous traversals across its widgets (elements); the State of traversal is maintained in an *independent* `Cursor` object.

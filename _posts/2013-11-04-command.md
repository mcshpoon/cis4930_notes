# Adapter (139)

## Pluggable Object Adapter

Example from book

![Image of FileSystem/Tree Display Diagram]()

Note: here we are using a delegate object; Hence we can adapt *all*
classes that implement the *Target* (delegate) interface. 

### A real life example: Java's JTable

# Command (233)

## Intent

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterise the
client with different requests, queue, or log requests, and support
undo-able operations.

### Example: Java's JButton & ActionListener

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
// ...

final JButton button = new JButton( "Press me!" );
button.addActionListener(
  new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent event ) {
      button.setText( "That tickles!" );
    }
  }
);

frame.getContentPane().add( button, BorderLayout.SOUTH );
```

![UML diagram of the above JFrame code]()

When clicked, the `JButton` calls a "generic" (not in the "parametric
class" sense, but rather the "common to all" sense) operation -- the
`ActionListenerImplementation` is encapsulating a requeset that is, is
acting like a GoF `Command`. 

The GoF's `execute()` is, in this case, the equivalent of
`actionPerformed()`

* we (e.g., from the `JButton`'s perspective) do *not* know *what* will
  happen when the button is pressed -- that is, we don't know which
*specific operations* will be executed. 
* we also do not know who the ultimae *receiver*(s) of that request will
  be. 

> Davis: In this case, it's coincindental that the ultimate receiver of
> the request is the thing that made the request in the first place --
> the button.

## Effect

Command decouples the object requesting an *abstract service* from the
*specific service* that will be performed __and__ decouples it from the
object(s) that will be performing that service. 

Command encapsulates both 

* the *specific request*(s) &
* the *specific reciever*(s)

## Reusability

Commands are generally *not* intended to be reusable across
applications. Consider the case of a GUI toolkit/framework: they need to
supply many kinds of widgets which *should* be highly reusable.
`Command` can be used to parameterise widgets, and thereby define the
widgets' *apparent* behaviour. Again, `Commands` are _not_ intended to
be particularly reusable because they are encapsulating
*application-specific* behaviours. 

## Observation

The pattern decouples the object that makes a request from the object(s)
that *actually* handle that request. Hence, the requestor need not have
any idea __at all__ about the handler. 

[Not at all](http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=not%20at%20at%20all) 

This is far more interesting (and powerful) than parameterising with a
function pointer. (as a callback). 

* a `Command` is a first class object
  - in some languages, a pointer to a function may not be a first class
    object
* a `Command` can maintain state
* a `Command` can support multiple operations
  - different people holding the `Command` object can call different
    operations. They don't need to all call the same thing. 
  - each operation could even be handled by a *different* handler
* a `Command` may have multiple instances
  - a function can only have 1 instance

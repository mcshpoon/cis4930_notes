# Administrivia

* Read: Iterator (257)

# HW6: Redux

* Use Template Method

# Composite (163)

## Variant: Restricted Composite

In its pure form, the `Composite` pattern does *not* restrict the nesting levvel nor the types of `Components` that can be children of a particular `Composite`; However, it may be useful to allow such restrictions. 

### Example

![4-block diagram]()

* in this system, we are restricted: 
	* in terms of depth
	* the type of children that a `ComputerComponent` can have.

Once assembled, the way a client will act with a `computerComponent` is uniform. However, by necessity, the construction process will not be transparent. 

## Implementing Operations

When we are implement operations, a `Composite` can:

* forward a request to *all* its children, and aggregate (or filter) the results
* forward a request to *selected* children and ... aggregate ...
* pass data to the children and ... aggregate ...
* override the children and handle the request alone

## Safety v. Transparency

This will be in large part dependent upon the implementation language.

__Transparency__ requires that everything [Composites & leafs] support the same interface. __Safety__ requires that classes not support operations that are for them, contextually meaningless. 

Consider the operations:

``` java
add( Component )
getChildren():Collection
makeIterator():Iterator
remove( Component )
```

*All* of these operations are reasonable for `Composite`s to support.

Which makes sense for `Leaf`s? 

> John: It makes sense to have just `remove()`. WRONG KIND OF REMOVE, It should be the remove( Component ) as in a child. 

> Davis: getChildren() should be supported, but return an empty collection. 

> Davis: makeIterator() as well. The others (add/remove) shouldn't be supported, according to him. 

### General OO Principle

Pushing functionality *up* (towards the base class) in a hierarchy is generally regarded as a *Very Bad Thing* -- to be clear, what we are talking about here are functionalities that are *not* common to all subtypes. 

The GoF's book's presentation has a bias towards languages that support static type checking. Therefore, they favour *transparency* over *safety*. Because otherwise, it'd be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to implement some of the pattern (e.g., `Composite`) using a statically typed language. When using a dynamically typed language, one can favour *safety*. 

Assuming a statically typed language: 

* How should a `Leaf` implement child management oeprations? (remember, Leafs are already children, shouldn't manage any others, cos it doesn't have any, YO)
	* flag an error
		- return an error code
		- throw an exception
	* do nothing

* Where should `Leaf` child management operations be implemented? 
	* in each `CLeaf` <- this is the worst choice 
	* in the `Component`: implements default (`Leaf`) behaviour which `Composite`s will override
	* in an abstract `Leaf`

## When *is* transparency truly important?

* the *creator* of a `Composite` will very likely have knowledge about what kinds of things it will be working with. If I am going to add something to a `Component`, chances are good that I *created* that `Component`, and thus know its type [hence whether or not it is a `Composite`]. 
* something manipulating a `Composite`'s structure (i.e., at some point in the future, adding/removing things from it) will likely, but *not certainly*, know what kind of thing it is.

Therefore, we can conclude that __transparency__ is most important for those things that will *interact* with the `Component`. 

## Implementation

* We've already discussed how to maintain the invariant, "If you think I'm your parent, I think you're my child."
* When implementing subclasses of `Leaf` or `Composite`, we should avoid extending their interface (because it can't be used polymorphically). 
* __ONLY__ the `Composite` [that is, the class that defines and maintains theh structure which holds the children] should forward messages to the children. While it may be tempting to make a `CComposite` talk directly to its children, it can make for less reusable/maintainable code. 

How about we just use a `Template` method instead? This is just like how you maintain the parent-child invariant.

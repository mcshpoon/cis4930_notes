# Administrivia

* make it maintain the invariant using TM
* ditch your version of `toString()` and use ....

``` java
public String toString(){
  return ( parent == null ) ?
    instanceID + " is the root" : 
    instanceID + " it the child of " + parent;
}
```

* define an interface `Iter<T>` that has GoF (or Dave) semantics
* for each subclass of `Component`, implement an appropriate
  `Iter<T>` *over its children*
* test your iterators
* challenge: implement a `makePreOrderIter()` [in class
  `Component`]
  - *do not use external resources: just the rules in the GoF book.* 

# Iterator (275)

## Intent

Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object
sequentially without exposing the underlying representation. 

## Initial Comment

The client will have no idea how the aggregate is (internally)
storing its values. 

## Primary motivation

1. maintaining encapsulation boundaries & promoting information hiding
2. avoid encumbering a class with accessor methods 
  - specifically, ones a *client* would use to access an instance's elements.
3. abstracts "iteration"
  - it is structure-independent
  - polymorphic iteration

## Structure

![Photo of diagram structure]()

> Davis: ConcreteAggregates need to implement the
> `createIterator()` so that it returns an iterator that is
> appropriate for *that* aggregate. 

## GoF iterator Semantics

The GoF iterator supports (at least) 4 operations. 

* GoF `isDone():boolean`
  - returns true IFF there is *no* element yet to be revealed by the
    iterator. 
* Davis `hasNext():boolean'` 
  - makes your while loop easier, saving an `!` 
  - returns true IFF there *is* an element yet to be revealed
* GoF `currentItem():Type` 
  - get the current element
* GoF `next():void`
  - advances the state of traversal
* GoF `first():void`
  - reset iterator to the beginning of the traversal
* Davis `reset():void`
  - same same

## Canonical usage

This example is an *external* iterator. 

``` java
Iterator iter = ...;
for( iter.reset(); iter.hasNext(); iter.next() ){
  // do something with iter.currentItem(); 
}
```

Note: `currentItem()` may be called multiple times within the loop's
body and each of those calls will return the *same* value. 

## Java iterator semantics

The Java interface `Iterator<T>` declares __3__ operations, at least
least *2* of which must be implemented. 

* `hasNext():boolean` 
  - true, IFF there *is* an element yet to be revealed
* `next():T` 
  - returns the current element __AND__ advances the state of iteration
    to the next element (if any)
* `remove()void`
  - This is an abomination! It pollutes the idea of an iterator, which
    is all about traversal, with collection management functionality. 
  - Though, it can be handy, and usually implemented as...

``` java
public void remove() throws UnsupportedOperationException{
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException(
    "I shall not fall into the ways of EVIL!" );
}.
``` 

### Canonical usage

``` java
Iterator<Type> iter = ...;
while( iter.hasNext() ) {
  // do something with iter.next();
} 
```

Note: `next()` should __only__ be called after `hasNext()` has been
verified to be true. Thus, the loop's body should call `next()` no more
than once. 

## What one should _never_ do to an aggregate while it's being
traversed: 

* add or remove elements

### Why?

Cos it's unsafe. 

Particularly, it's unsafe in the context of concurrent programs, but
it's also an issue in non-concurrent programs. 

Davis: There is an assumption there, that the thing being iterated on is
shared between one or more threads/processes. 

Assume a list with _n_ items

* create an iterator visit the first n/2 items
* something adds/removes an element from the list
* you call `iter.next()` (assuming Java sematics)
  - What happens? 
    * In java, you get a `IllegalStateException`, which indicates that
      the aggregate has been modified, and thus the state of the
iterator has been *invalidated*.

* Why? Because we might otherwise:
  * visit an element again
  * skip an element
  * get an `OutOfBoundsException` (or similar), because an element no
    longer exists. 

## Types of Iterators

### External Iterators

* the *client* requests an iterator from the aggregate it wants to
  traverse
* the *client* is responsible for the code that interacts with each
  element -- e.g.,

``` java
for( iter.reset(); iter.hasNext(); iter.next() )
  // do something with iter.currentItem(); 
```

### Internal Iterators

* the *client* passes an "operation" to the _aggregate_
* the *aggregate* is responsible for traversing itself, and applying
  that operation to each of its elements

### Cursor

THAT'S FOR LAT0R, when we get to another pattern :)

Its purpose: traversal-related. That's why it's mentioned now, yo. 

## A comparison

| title       | internal     | External     | Cursor    |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| traversal control | in aggregate | in iterator | in aggregate |
| simultaneous traversal? | no | possible | possible |
| ease of supporting multiple traversal algorithms | __very__ hard |
doable | doable, but __ugly__ | 
| fine-grained control? | no | yes | yes |

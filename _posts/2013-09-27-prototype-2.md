# Administrivia

* The semester is already 1/3 over!
* Read: Decorator(175)

# Prototype (117)

## Implementation (cont.)

## What Object's `clone()` does conceptually 

``` java
public Object clone() {
  if ( ! instanceof( Cloneable ) )
    throw new CloneNotSupportedException();
  // create and return a bitwise (shallow) copy of the (entire) object
}
```

### Aside

The interface `Cloneable` doesn't declare any operations: it serves as a
"tag" that enables the `clone()` operation to execute without throwing
an exception. For security reasons, being able to clone *any* object is
a bad idea; the designers wanted to ensure that only instances of
classes that were explicitly deemed safe to clone (by their designers)
could in fact be cloned.

## Customising clones

A clone's state is often similar to, but not exactly the same as the
`Prototype`'s. 

### Where does the clone get customised?

* during the cloning process
* after cloning -- the *client* explicitly adjusts the clone's state

## Boilerplates

Rather than specify  how to make *x* from scratch, we are instead given
a *y* that is reasonably close to what we want, and then we customise
it.

> Dave: Sometimes, we want to say: "This is how x differs from y"

* Boilerplates can be implemented with 2 different design patterns (TBA)
  * Prototype
  * Decorator

Idea is to be able to customise key things, like filling in the blanks. 

### Prototype-based boilerplates

Idea: clone the boilerplate, then edit the copy. 

#### The SLIP (Student Life Insurance Policy)

![Student Life Insurance Policy](http://i.imgur.com/4MG04oE.jpg "UML diagram")

DaveCo Insurance offers 3 standard SLIPs (each a prototype), which can
be tailored to a particular customer's desires. 

> John: But do they *need* to be? 

* Basic
* Deluxe
* Premium

Customers can then customise their coverage

* Add/remove events from base policy
* modify coverage amounts/limits
* &c.

##### Issuing a SLIP is a 3-step process

Really, it's "up to" three steps

Steps: 

###### 1. clone the desired prototype

``` java
{
  SLIP slip = (SLIP) super.clone(); // shallow copy
  slipmap = slip.map.clone();       // own set event/policies
(super.map.clone() is the same thing, and more clear)

  return slip;
}
```

###### 2. Personalise with the client's details

* set policy number
* set coverage dates
* ...
* set the DATE OF BIRTH

###### 3. Customise coverage (as desired)

``` java
slip.setCoverage( tattooEvent, new Policy( 100%, $10000 ) );
removeCoverage( infectedPiercingEvent );
```

##### Observations on implementing Boilerplates with Prototypes

* Pro: easy to implement
* Con: potentially high storage cost
* Con: no "history" of the changes
  -must compare item-by-item to detect changes
* Con: complexity can increase as the system evolves

Overall: Goodf or simple cases *without* deeply nested objects. 

# Decorator (175)

## Intent

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorator
provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. 

## Initial Comment 

The phrase "additional" responsibilities may be misleading, because it
makes one think of adding *new* behaviours. While that *is* possible with
Decorator, the pattern is far more commonly used to *extend* or
*replace* existing behaviours. 

## Structure (alternative to what appears in the GoF boek)

It's often better to have *two* sub-hierarchies of `Component`. 

![Dave's Image]( )

This will look a bit different from the book.

> Davis: A decorator has a ref/pointer to something that is a component. That
> component can either be a core component, or a decorator. 

## Participants (alternative to what appears in the GoF boek)

### CoreComponent

Implements those features which should be shared by *all* `CComponents`

* Without it, we'd need to localise those features in either: 
  * `Component`
    - con: it would encumber decorator with unnecessary stuff that it (the
      decorator) would need to inherit. This is particularly troublesome
when it comes to attributes, because the decorator __won't__ use them.
They will just occupy memory unnecessarily
  * in *each* and *every* `CComponent` class
    - con: replicated code is difficult to maintain. 
      * the replicated code needs to propagate to all copies - it's easy
        to forget one.

### Decorator

implements all the operations of `Component` as "forward this request to
my component."

* pro: simplifies the implementation of CDecorators, because one needs
  only to override the operation(s) that the `Decorator` is enhancing. 

### ConcreteDecorator

overrides *specific* `Component` operation(s)

* __extend__ an operation so that it does work before and/or after
  forwarding the request to the component. 

> Davis: If I override a method `foo()`, and I have something like
> `doBefore()`, and then have stuff after it.

* __replace__ an operation, so that the `CDecorator` is solely
  responsible for fulfilling the request. 

* __define__ new behaviour(s)
  * Davis: "UGGHHH, MOOMMMMMM!"

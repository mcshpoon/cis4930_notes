# Adapter (139)

## Intent

Convert the interface of a class into another interface that
clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't
otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. 

## Varieties

![Varieties photo]()

There are four: class adapters, (tailored) adapter, pluggable
adapters, and object adapters

### Tailored Adapters

There is an *existing* class that has the functionality we need, but it
lacks the required interface. 

Simple example: a `LinkedList` won't (or at least, shouldn't) have
operations named `push()`, `pop()`, & `peek()`, but it almost certainly
will have equivalent functionalities. 

#### Tailored class adapter 

Define a subclass of the existing class (e.g., `LinkedList`) that
implements the desired interface (`Stack`), in terms of the existing
class' operations: 

![Implementation of a Stack/LinkedList]()

> Davis: `decaudate()` means to cut something's tail off

The `Adaptor` is the stack, the `Adaptee` is the `LinkedList`

Note: some languages (e.g., C++) support the notion of *private
(implementation) inheritance*.

* Also, the __type__ is *not* inherited, only the code is. 
  - in C++, all the operations become `private` in the subclass
    *regardless* of their original access modifiers. Hence, if using
private inheritance, `MyStack` would need to re-implement the
`isEmpty()` operations. 
    * Why? It's because the inherited one would be private, and
      inaccessible for others to touch. 

* Tailored Class Adapter summary
  * con: can only adapt a class (and *not* its subclasses)
    - this is because it's __explicitly__ adapting a certain class
  * pro: avoids message forwarding overhead

#### Tailored object adapter

Define a class that implements the desired interface (e.g., `Stack`) in
terms of forwarding calls to the existing class's operations. Relies on
object composition 

> Davis: We are adapting an __interface__ and not a __class__. 

### Pluggable Adapters

> Davis: Slow, probably on exam 

The class that the (client) code is meant to work with is *unknown*!
We'll define an interface so that we can work with this unknown class.
In other words, we want to write a class _today_, that in order to do
its job, we'll need to work with classes that we can't forsee. 

The implementor (of the class that we are writing today) must identify
*all* the operations that the `Adaptee` needs to support in order for
*this* class to do its job. We will write code in terms of those
(unimplemented) operations.

> CoolGuy123: Programmer writes interface, then other people program to that?

#### Pluggable Class Adapter

Example from the BOEK 

> Tall Guy: Looks like template method. 

* Adapter: DirectoryTreeDisplay
* Adaptee: FileSystemEntity
* Client & Target Interface: TreeDisplay
  - defines & uses the target interface

* `TreeDisplay` defines
  * the _target interface_, and
  * since it also __uses__ the target interface, it is also the (target
    interface's) _client_

> Davis: Where is it defining the Target Interface? 

The two abstract methods.

* `FileSystemEntity` is the `Adaptee`
  * it is the "unforeseen" class whose abilities we now want to use in
    the context of displaying trees

* `DirectoryTreeDisplay`
  * is the _Adapter_
  * enables the _Client_ (`TreeDisplay`) to use the functionalities of
    the `AdAaptee` (FileSystemEntity) by adapting it to the target
interface. 

Note: this __all__ hinges on the abstract class operations -- which ae
implemented by the `Adapter`.

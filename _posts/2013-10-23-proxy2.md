# Administrivia

* Exam Friday night: DIFFERENT BUILDING & ROOM

# Homework #8 Redeux

* He wants us to call `accept()` on all the nodes
* And to put operations in the evaluate Visitor, not in the nodes

# Proxy (207)

## Implementation 

* C++ supports the idea of *operator overloading*, whereby the
  programmer can define the behaviour of a (standard) operator when
used with specific types. 

* `.`   <= member access
* `->`  <= member access (when the Left Hand Side is a pointer to an
  object/struct)

Hence, the operator `->` is often overloaded to enable *transpart*
smart-pointers. (e.g., proxy objects that *behave* like regular
pointers)

* Smalltalk has `doesNotUnderstand`
  - specifies which object to forward messages that aren't part of this
    object's interface
* Java can create proxies dynamically

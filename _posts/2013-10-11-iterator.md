#  Iterator (257)

## Aside: Java's for-each loop syntax

Classes which implement the interface `Iterable<T>` have an `iterator()` that returns an `Iterator<T>` over instances of that class's elements. Iterable classes and arrays (which areteriously *not* Iterable) can be used with the "for-each" loop

``` java
for ( ElementType e : someIterableAggregate ) {
	// do stuff with e :)
}
```

this syntax transparently creates an iterator and uses it to assign successive values to the variable `e`. When reading code (as "English", out loud :)) one reads:

> "For each `ElementType`, e, in  `someIterableAggregate...`"

## Potential for Encapsulation Violation

> Davis: There is a potential for encapsulation violation for for-each loops. Cos, you can __violate__ the aggregate, and touch its soft innards.

Implementation details must often be exposed to the `Iterator`. For instance, iif a `Foo` stores its data in a linked list...

in some languages (e.g., Smalltalk), we'd need to violate encapsulation boundaries to implement this. In other languages, it can be a *lesser* violation. [e.g., C++, the `Iterator` can be declared a `friend` of the List]. In Java, we might consider the `Iterator` an extension of the host-object if it is implemented as an inner-cclass [because inner-classes implicitly have access to the defining object's private stuff [they are defined in the object's scope]]. 

``` java
class Foo {
	private List<Bar> data;
	public Iterator<Bar> makeIterator(){
		return data.makeIterator();	
	}
}
```

Note: this is not for-each compatible. We would need to implement an interface and use a different method name. 

Note: the request to create an iterator is forwarded to the aggregate structure. 

``` java
class List<T> {
	private Node<T> head;
	private Node<T> tail;

	public Iterator<T> makeIterator() {
		return new Iterator<T>() {
			private final Node<T> first = head;
			private final Node<T> current = head;
			
			public void reset() {
				current = first;
			}
			public boolean isDone(){
				return (current == null);
			}

			public T currentItem() {
				return current.getData();
			}

			public void next() {
				current = current.getNext();
			}
		}
	} // end of makeIterator

	// other List ops elided
}
```

Note: We're trying to minimise the degree of encapsulation violations. We don't have access to the `Node`, just the `List`. 

Here he is using anonymous classes. 

Note: this class didn't actually need a `first` variable as it has implicit access to the defining object's `head` variable.

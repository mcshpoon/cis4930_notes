## How many `Subject`s can an `Observer` observer?

* When an `Observer` can watch more than one `Subject`
	* it must abe able to distinguish *which* `Subject` is the source of a notification
		- one way to accomplish this is to pass a reference to the `Subject` as part of the notification. 
	* could also use distinct notification methods

## What happens with a `Client` performs several state changing operations on a `Subject`? 

* If we don't do something to prevent it => we will get a notification cascade. 
	- each and every op will cause *all* of the `Observer`s to be notified
		* this *may* be desirable
		* in many cases, (if not most) it is not desirable because it is inefficient

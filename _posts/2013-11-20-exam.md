# Administrivia

* Read: Singleton (127) & Chain of Responsibilities (223)
* Exam 3 Friday night
* Focus is on material not on exams 1 & 2
  - suggest to read the forward/afterward for each of the
    sections (structural, behavioural, & creational)
  - read: CH2. case study
     * configurable formatting - creating config files that the editor
       can read and customise its behaviour. -- configurable via scripts
vs. changing the source code

#  Facade (185)

## Implementation notes

> Davis: We wanna avoid returning subsystem objects to the client. The
> subsystem objects would be things that are meant for the things within
> the Facade-block to work with, not external things. 

* Avoid returning subsystem objects to the client. 
  - to do otherwise would couple the client with subsystem internals :(
  - but, it may not be avoidable

> Davis: Consider the common abstract operations
* When developing an application
  - use `Facade` to "hide" an evolving system 
    * avoids writing code in terms of a set of potentially transitory
      classes/operations. 

* Can be used to avoid overhead & network traffic in distributed systems
  - we can void this ![image of local/remote system network]()
  - and instead do this ![image of facade'd network system]()

* Note: the choice of which remote client to use has been pushed from
  the client to the server. 

## Using multiple `Facade`s

* When there are multiple subsystems with (at least conceptually) the same
responsibilities, each can have a `Facade` that implements a *common
interface*. 
  * allows code to work with the subsystems __interchangably__.

* Consider networking subsystems, each of which implements a different
protocol. (e.g., TCP/IP, IPX, NetBIOS, &c.) but have a common set of
abstract operations. 
  - connect
  - disconnect
  - send buffer
  - receive a buffer

By defining a common interface, we can now implement software that is
protocol-independent (even using more than one protocol in the same
application). 

> Davis: using multiple `Facade`s takes the idea of variations from a
> class `level` to a `Package` level. 

## Common mistakes

### Subclassing the Facade to add new behaviour

A `Facade` is intended to simplify and centralise access (to a
subsystem), *not* add behaviours. 

### Turning the Facade into a "manager"

* The `Facade` should *not* reimplement functionality provided by the
subsystem
  - doing so would very likely result in a "GOD" object

> Davis: And we know that all GOD objects are __evil__ 

### Failing to provide a *clean* interface

It should *simplify* access.

## When implementing a Facade, remember...

* a message should perform a __complete complex__ action. 
* it's not a `Factory` that returns subsystem objects
* the client says, "do X", and the `Facade` does *all* the required
  work. 

# Bridge (151)

## Intent

Decouple abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary
independently. 

## Initial Comments

Recall the dictum: 

> Program to an interface, not an implementation

| language construct | semantic meaning | `Bridge` participants |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| interface          | type             | abstraction           |
| class              | implementation   | class                 |

While a single type may have *many* implementing classes, when we
consider a *specific object*, that object's class binds together both
the interface and the implementation. 

`Bridge` splits the _interface_ and _implementation_ into two separate,
collaborating objects, that together act as a single logical object
(combining the _interface_ and _implementation_). 

## Structure

![structure of Bridge]()

## Bridge is a special case of __Collaborating Hierarchies__

With `Bridge`, the *Abstraction* and *Implementation* vary
__independently__. However, the `Client` __always__ and **only**
collaborates with the *Abstraction* (the *Implementor* is hidden and
does not have a "public" interface for `Client`s -- it has only a
priveleged interface for the *Abstractions* to use). 

## Towards the `Bridge` pattern: successive designs

This gonna show development of code leading up to the use of the `Bridge` pattern.

We've been tasked with writing an application that will interface with
__TigerCAD__.

* our application offloads the responsibility for drawing 

### Take 1

![take 1]()

* Wait...
  * What happens when we have customers wanting to use our application with
    a different CAD program? (whose interface is incompatible with
    TigerCAD's) 

### Solution: Take 1

![take 2]()

Using template method. 

> Davis: while we could use an `AbstractFactory` to instantiate the
> proper `Shape` types for the drawing application, we're actually
> using. 

* Cons: class explosion
  - for each drawing application supported, we must implement all the
    `Shape` variants. 

### Solution: Take 2

![take 2]()

Give a `Shape` a `draw()` operation, and have a `Shape` for each
`DrawingApplication`. 

We separated the classes that are dependent upon a particular drawing
application into their own hierarchies. 

> Davis: this is a better solution, but it doesn't address the class
> explosion issue. 

> John: kinda like `Visitor`

Note: there is now no longer a `Circle` class as an abstraction; there
are only `Shape`s as an abstraction. 

* We've lost the specialised shape types (e.g., Circle, Rectangle, &c.)
  * probably not going to be an issue

* How could custom (unanticipated) shapes (e.g., Trapezoid) be handled? 
  * introduce [empty] interfaces for the classes to "implement"
  * use the `Visitor` pattern

### Solution: Take 3 => Bridge

![take 3 => bridge]()

> Davis: we have something that is capable of *drawing* a shape, then we
> subclass __that__ for specific drawing applications

The _Abstraction_ `Shape` has been separated from the implementation
that is drawn. 

* How do the specialised _Abstractions_ access the _Implementor_?

# Administrivia

* Exam 3 tonight: same room as last time
  - bridge is fair game
  - no singleton or chainz
* course evaluations: *please wait until the __last__ day*to do them

# Bridge (151)

## Continuation of the evolving CAD software

How do specialised *Abstractions* access the *Implementor*?

* How about make `imp` a protected member of `Shape`
  - That's bad! It's glassbox/whitebox inheritanceA
  - couples specialised *Abstractions* to the __class__ `Shape`'s
    implementation. 
  - also couples the specialised *Abstractions* to the
    *Implementation*'s interface

* How about an accessor method? 
  - make `Shape` support an *accessor* method to return a
    reference/pointer to `imp`
  - blackbox inheritance :)
  - couples *Abstractions* to the class `Shape`'s interface -- but that
    isn't BAD -- it's coupled to its parent's interface; that's normal

* How about implement protected *concrete* operations in the
  *Abstraction* __class__
  - these operations make calls to the *Implementor*-operations e.g.,
    * `draw()` would be defined in terms of the protected operations
      * the protected operations named do *not* have to conform to the
        *Implementation* operation names
      * can help eliminate replicated code (when the *Abstraction*
        operations are at a higher level of abstraction than the
        *Implementation* -- i.e., it may require multiple
*Implementation* ops to be called [consider the imp providing arcs and
line segments, but we want to do things like draw polygons and circles]

# Singleton (127)

## Intent

Ensure that a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of
access to it. 

## Motivation

To ensure correctness and/or seucrity. 

> Davis: We don't want someone to be able
to make a parallel object representing a bank account, cos one of them
could have stuff siphoned away from it. In terms of correctness, there are many systems, that
depend on there being only one instance existing. 

## Alternative to a class that has only static members

> inflexible.

What happens, when at some point in the future, the design requirements
change, and multiple instances *are* needed? Code written in terms of
static operations will need to be rewritten. 

## Canonical Implementation

```java
class Singleton {

  static private Singleton instance = new Singleton();

  static public Singleton getInstance(){ return Singleton.instance; }
  
  private Singleton() {...};

  // other operations are elided

}
```

> Davis: Since there's no public constructors, *nobody* except the
> *class itself* can make an instance of the class. 

## Lazy Initialisation

Often, you'll see an implementation using lazy initialisation. When the
cost of instantiating a `Singleton` is high, we may want to defer doing
so until the point it is actually needed.

```java
class Singleton {

  static private Singleton instance = new Singleton();

  static public Singleton getInstance(){
    if( Singleton.instance == null )
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
     return Singleton.instance;
  }
  
  private Singleton() {...};

  // other operations are elided

}
```

## Big Problem with both forms

As-written here, neither form is thread safe (at least in Java). 

Even varieties using *double-checked locking* weren't (until more
recently) thread safe. 

## How to allow multiple "Singletons"

If the design requirements change, all we need to do is update the
`getInstance()` method to return a `new` object rather than returning a
shared object. 

## Subclassing & Singleton

Depending on the language, it's possible, but not pretty. At least it's
not *impossible*, as it would be if we were using a static class. 

# Monostate (??? -- DOESN'T EXIST IN BOEK)

An alternative to `Singleton` 

## Idea

Rather than having one *shared* instance of a class, we can have
*multiple instances* as long as they all share the same data. 

```java
class Monostate {
  static private Attribute = initialValue;
  
  // notice it's not a static method
  public void setAttribute( Attribute newValue ){
    Monostate.attribute = newValue;
  }

  public Attribute getAttributte() {
    return Monostate.attribute;
  }

  // &c. 
}
```

Notice: the static members are accessed and manipulated by
*instance-level* operations. 

As presented here, this code also has thread safety issues; Though, they
are *easily* fixed.
